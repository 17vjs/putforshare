# Problem to be solved 
`Person:
Store and retrieve Person Information like name, mobile_num, email, profile_picture.

You have to build APIs, Make sure your API is secure. Only Admin with given username, password  ( credential ) can perform the operation.

/get-all-Person - Get all Person in the file.
/add-Person - Append one new Person details and his profile picture given as input, to the file at the end.
/add-many-Person - Add multiple Person given as an array at the end of the file.

Create above API endpoints for the above in your backend, and also build a frontend app in angular / reactjs.
All endpoints should return only JSON.
All Person should be stored in a text file not in a database.`
